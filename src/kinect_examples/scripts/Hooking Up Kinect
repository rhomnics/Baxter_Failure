1. First make sure both usb and external power source for kinect are plugged in
2. go into command line and type in "lsusb" make sure it lists the following

Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Camera
Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Motor
Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Audio


3. Follow this tutorial:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Hooking-up-a-Kinect-to-your-Computer-Using-Ubuntu/

Note: you might have some trouble on page 9 step 3 of this tutorial, my advice, before advancing to this part do the following

go to /etc

go to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/

create a file in it called RawKinectViewer.conf    
enter the following into that file

Note this is just where I place my Kinect-2.8-001 file, you could have placed it
somewhere else. It could also be a different version, though when you go to download it 
I'd recommend this one as it's stable and compatible with everything we're working with.

/home/{YOURUSERNAME}/Kinect-2.8-001/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

4. Follow these instructions but only as far as downloading all the dependencies and such (particularly OpenKinect)
